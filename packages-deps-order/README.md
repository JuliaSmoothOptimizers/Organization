The list of packages considered is in `list_jso_packages.dat`. See `Organization\pkgs_data` folder.


## TODO:
- [ ] Improve logging (especially for test/Project.toml)
- [ ] Differentiate easily deps and test deps
- [ ] We don't see anything on the graph...
- [ ] Simplify calling from a terminal
- [ ] Visualize the result of the ordering (especially to see simultaneous up)
